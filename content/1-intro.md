**Note:** The aim of this workshop is to get you up and running with REDCap quickly. We aim to cover the fundamentals well enough that you can start to use the service.

For this reason we've left out advanced topics like scheduled invitations, randomisation and longitudinal study design.

A significant amount of careful planning and design needs to happen before you start building your survey. The stronger your preparation, the more credible your methodology will be.

Your **preparation** phase should have included:

- Research problem development
- Literature review
- Concept mapping and identification of measures
- Survey cohort identification

Your **design** phase should have included: 

- Clarifying the _answers_ you want (not the questions)
- Question design
- Question validation
- Sampling design
